<p><strong>Webextremelinks.com</strong> adheres strictly to a non-refund policy. As we offer non-tangible, irrevocable products and services to our customers, refunds are not honored once the service or guest post link is delivered.</p>
<p>By purchasing packages, subscription plans, or sponsored guest post services from <strong>Webextremelinks.com</strong>, you agree that all payments are non-refundable, except in specific cases outlined below. We expect customers to understand this policy before making any purchases through our website.</p>
<h5><strong>Refunds will not be granted for the following reasons:</strong></h5>
<p>The poor or improper technical performance of partner news websites, press release aggregating websites, and publisher websites, including issues such as website availability 24/7, loading speed, presence of hyperlinks, search engine indexing, third-party comments, text layout, content, and style. No exceptions will be made for equality.</p>
<h5><strong>Our Money Back Guarantee:</strong></h5>
<p>If, for any reason, we are unable to publish an article or guest post on the publisher websites you have ordered, you will be eligible for a full refund, minus payment gateway fees. In such cases, we may offer to redo the order on similar publisher websites or credit the amount to your <strong>Webextremelinks.com</strong> Wallet account for future use. However, you always have the option for a full refund if you prefer.</p>
<h5><strong>Refunds During the Writing Process:</strong></h5>
<p>When you place an order, we use your payment to pre-pay our writers to work on your order. Therefore, if you change your mind during the article writing or review process, we can only offer a 50% refund. You will still receive your news article and be able to request revisions. The completed article will belong to you for any purpose you choose.</p>
<h5><strong>Refunds During the Publishing Process:</strong></h5>
<p>Refunds requested during the publishing of a guest post process will be denied. We cannot halt a publication that is in progress nor recoup the costs incurred for publishing an article. Please ensure thorough review of your article before approving it for publication. While we strive for error-free articles, it is advisable to check if the article meets your requirements, the business contact details are accurate, spelling and grammar are correct, keywords provided are used appropriately, and the links function correctly.</p>
<h5><strong>Refund Processing Time:</strong></h5>
<p>Refunds will be either approved or denied within 24 hours of receiving your request. Credit card refunds will be credited back to your card within 5 â€“ 10 business days. PayPal refunds will be instantly visible in your PayPal account upon processing. Funds should be available immediately if paid with your PayPal balance. If paid using a card or bank account, funds are typically available within five business days, subject to your bank&#8217;s processing times. Refunds will always be issued back to the PayPal account, bank account, or card used for payment. Unfortunately, refunds cannot be processed to a different account.</p>
<h5><strong>How to Request a Refund:</strong></h5>
<p>To request a refund, initiate a chat by clicking the chat bubble in the bottom right-hand corner of the site or send an email to info@your website.com. Ensure to include the email address used for the order and the order number when requesting a refund.</p>
<p>Customers dissatisfied with services can submit complaints to the <strong>Webextremelinks.com</strong> support team. Please contact us within seven days of purchase.</p>
<p>You must provide clear evidence that the purchased product or service does not meet its description on our website. We do not entertain complaints based solely on false customer expectations or desires.</p>
